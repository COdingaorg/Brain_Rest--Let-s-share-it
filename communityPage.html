        <h5>Mental Health And Wellbeing 2020 In Review | Everything You Need To Know</h5>
        <p id="author">Anjali Sing</p>
        <p class="theStory">
          Year 2020!

          This phrase is likely to bring different emotions to everyone. This year has definitely been a roller-coaster
          ride for all in terms of emotions, finances, relationships, and mental health. The excitement of entering the
          new year was soon replaced with apprehensive thoughts, worrisome thinking, fearful emotions, and feeling of
          helplessness.

          That is the reason why this year has seen a massive shift in how we view mental health. Today we are going to
          see the year 2020 and mental health in the review. We also have a special section on how Calm Sage has
          contributed its part during this most important year of mental wellness.

          Mental Health and 2020: In Review
          COVID-19 and Mental Health: 2020 in Review
          Many research have been carried out to understand the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of an
          individual. It was seen that both people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who didn’t, experienced a negative
          impact on their mental health. Some of the common mental issues that were linked with COVID-19 are anxiety,
          depression, self-reported stress, disturbed sleep, phobias, and more.

      <h5>Common Marriage Problems and Solutions</h5>
      <p id="author">Elizabeth Scott</p>
      <p class="theStory2">
        Relationships offer wonderful benefits for well-being, life satisfaction, and stress management, but none are
        without their challenges. These issues can put a strain on a couple, but working through them can either
        strengthen their bond or push them apart, depending on how they handle the challenges they face.

        Working through marriage problems in a healthy way can be very difficult, especially because stressors can
        come from many different sources. The following are some of the most common sources of marital stress and
        marriage problems.

      <p class="theStory3">
        To understand why stress affects thinking and memory, it's important to understand a little about how the brain
        works. Your brain isn't just a single unit, but a group of different parts that perform different tasks, says
        Dr. Ressler. Researchers believe that when one part of your brain is engaged, the other parts of your brain may
        not have as much energy to handle their own vital tasks, he says. For example, if you are in a dangerous or
        emotionally taxing situation, the amygdala (the part of your brain that governs your survival instincts) may
        take over, leaving the parts of your brain that help to store memories and perform higher-order tasks with less
        energy and ability to get their own jobs done. "The basic idea is that the brain is shunting its resources
        because it's in survival mode, not memory mode," says Dr. Ressler. This is why you might be more forgetful when
        you are under stress or may even experience memory lapses during traumatic events.

        The effect that stress has on the brain and body may also differ depending on when it occurs in the course of
        someone's life, says Goldstein. Certain hormones, known as gonadal hormones — which are secreted in large
        amounts during fetal development, puberty, and pregnancy and depleted during menopause — may play a role in how
        stress affects an individual, says Goldstein. "For example, reductions in the gonadal hormone estradiol during
        the menopausal transition may change how our brain responds to stress," she says.

      <h5>Struggles as a woman</h5>
      <p id="author">Rosa Pavanelli</p>
      <p class="theStory4">
        It is inspiring to see how the International Women’s Strike is building on the past to create a “new
        international feminist movement that will build a bridge between women’s resistance and labour resistance”.

        This struggle is based on six key principles:

        An End to Gender Violence
        Labour Rights
        An Antiracist and Anti-imperialist Feminism
        Full Social Provisioning
        Reproductive and Environmental Justice for All
        We need to fight for public services as the bed rock for this renewed solidarity, providing both women and men
        with their essential needs and fulfilling our most basic human rights.

        We need to build support for the brave workers who deliver these services to their communities.

        We need to integrate gender responsive and transformative strategies to ensure non-discriminatory public
        services, tailored to our needs.

        Quality public services work to redistribute power and resources and help create an economic and cultural
        environment ready to challenge the patriarchy and fight for equality. They also enable us to protect our local
        environments and reduce the harmful impact of the relentless pursuit of profit which is destroying our world.
        This is why from Brazil to the USA, from Italy to Hungary, right-wing governments are attacking public service
        workers and women’s rights all together.
