        <h5>Mental Health And Wellbeing 2020 In Review | Everything You Need To Know</h5>
        <p id="author">Anjali Sing</p>
        <p class="theStory">
          Year 2020!

          This phrase is likely to bring different emotions to everyone. This year has definitely been a roller-coaster
          ride for all in terms of emotions, finances, relationships, and mental health. The excitement of entering the
          new year was soon replaced with apprehensive thoughts, worrisome thinking, fearful emotions, and feeling of
          helplessness.

          That is the reason why this year has seen a massive shift in how we view mental health. Today we are going to
          see the year 2020 and mental health in the review. We also have a special section on how Calm Sage has
          contributed its part during this most important year of mental wellness.

          Mental Health and 2020: In Review
          COVID-19 and Mental Health: 2020 in Review
          Many research have been carried out to understand the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of an
          individual. It was seen that both people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who didn’t, experienced a negative
          impact on their mental health. Some of the common mental issues that were linked with COVID-19 are anxiety,
          depression, self-reported stress, disturbed sleep, phobias, and more.

        <p>Being bullied can be disheartening and miserable for the one being subjected
           to bullying. Bullying not only happens to children or teenagers but adults can too 
           become victims of bullying – 
          at the workplace, in families, in relationships, and other social settings.

          Having a strong support system can help you feel not alone. Having people you trust
           around you to back you up can be helpful. Your support system is there to help you, 
           encourage you, and help you stay positive. If you’re having trouble dealing with 
           bullies, then you can trust your support system for advice. Bullying can be scary 
           but it can feel less scary when you have a support system to fall back on.

          If you find yourself being bullied, then you need to speak up and report the incident 
          to concerned authorities. Staying silent when you’re being bullied is not healthy or helpful. 
          If you speak up and stand up against your bullies today then you are less likely to feel the 
          long-term effects of bullying.Remember that by speaking up and standing strong,
           you’re also helping others who can’t stand against their bullies themselves.

          Like mentioned before, dealing with bullies and the effects of bullying can be challenging. 
          If you’re facing trouble overcoming the challenges, it is better to seek professional help 
          from a mental healthcare provider. A therapist or counselor can help you learn how to block
           the source of bullying and find various coping techniques to help you deal with your bullies.

        <p>
          The first thing you can do to overcome the effects of bullying is – allowing yourself to just feel 
          the emotions flowing through you. Many times, people are told to “get over it” but it is not healthy 
          if you don’t allow yourself to process your emotions. Bullying can cause you to feel anger, sadness, 
          hurt, frustration, irritation, etc., and experiencing such emotions is okay.
