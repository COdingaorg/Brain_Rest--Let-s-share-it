      <h5>Mental Health And Wellbeing 2020 In Review | Everything You Need To Know</h5>
      <p id="author">Anjali Sing</p>
      <p class="theStory">
        <h1> Mental health and 2020</h1>

        This phrase is likely to bring different emotions to everyone. This year has definitely been a roller-coaster
        ride for all in terms of emotions, finances, relationships, and mental health. The excitement of entering the
        new year was soon replaced with apprehensive thoughts, worrisome thinking, fearful emotions, and feeling of
        helplessness.

        That is the reason why this year has seen a massive shift in how we view mental health. Today we are going to
        see the year 2020 and mental health in the review. We also have a special section on how Calm Sage has
        contributed its part during this most important year of mental wellness.

        Mental Health and 2020: In Review
        COVID-19 and Mental Health: 2020 in Review
        Many research have been carried out to understand the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of an
        individual. It was seen that both people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who didn’t, experienced a negative
        impact on their mental health. Some of the common mental issues that were linked with COVID-19 are anxiety,
        depression, self-reported stress, disturbed sleep, phobias, and more.

      <h5>Common Marriage Problems and Solutions</h5>
      <p id="author">Elizabeth Scott</p>
      <p class="theStory2">
        <h1>Working through marriage problemsz</h1>
        Relationships offer wonderful benefits for well-being, life satisfaction, and stress management, but none are
        without their challenges. These issues can put a strain on a couple, but working through them can either
        strengthen their bond or push them apart, depending on how they handle the challenges they face.

        Working through marriage problems in a healthy way can be very difficult, especially because stressors can
        come from many different sources. The following are some of the most common sources of marital stress and
        marriage problems.

      <h5>How i empty my Brain after hard work</h5>
      <p id="author">Healthline</p>
      <p class="theStory3">
        <h1>How stress affects thinking and memory</h1>
        To understand why stress affects thinking and memory, it's important to understand a little about how the brain
        works. Your brain isn't just a single unit, but a group of different parts that perform different tasks, says
        Dr. Ressler. Researchers believe that when one part of your brain is engaged, the other parts of your brain may
        not have as much energy to handle their own vital tasks, he says. For example, if you are in a dangerous or
        emotionally taxing situation, the amygdala (the part of your brain that governs your survival instincts) may
        take over, leaving the parts of your brain that help to store memories and perform higher-order tasks with less
        energy and ability to get their own jobs done. "The basic idea is that the brain is shunting its resources
        because it's in survival mode, not memory mode," says Dr. Ressler. This is why you might be more forgetful when
        you are under stress or may even experience memory lapses during traumatic events.

        The effect that stress has on the brain and body may also differ depending on when it occurs in the course of
        someone's life, says Goldstein. Certain hormones, known as gonadal hormones — which are secreted in large
        amounts during fetal development, puberty, and pregnancy and depleted during menopause — may play a role in how
        stress affects an individual, says Goldstein. "For example, reductions in the gonadal hormone estradiol during
        the menopausal transition may change how our brain responds to stress," she says.

      <h5>Struggles as a woman</h5>
      <p id="author">Rosa Pavanelli</p>
      <p class="theStory4">
        <h1>What are struggles women go through</h1>
        It is inspiring to see how the International Women’s Strike is building on the past to create a “new
        international feminist movement that will build a bridge between women’s resistance and labour resistance”.

        This struggle is based on six key principles:

        An End to Gender Violence
        Labour Rights
        An Antiracist and Anti-imperialist Feminism
        Full Social Provisioning
        Reproductive and Environmental Justice for All
        We need to fight for public services as the bed rock for this renewed solidarity, providing both women and men
        with their essential needs and fulfilling our most basic human rights.

        We need to build support for the brave workers who deliver these services to their communities.

        We need to integrate gender responsive and transformative strategies to ensure non-discriminatory public
        services, tailored to our needs.

        Quality public services work to redistribute power and resources and help create an economic and cultural
        environment ready to challenge the patriarchy and fight for equality. They also enable us to protect our local
        environments and reduce the harmful impact of the relentless pursuit of profit which is destroying our world.
        This is why from Brazil to the USA, from Italy to Hungary, right-wing governments are attacking public service
        workers and women’s rights all together.

        <h1>WHAT IS SOCIAL ISOLATION?</h1>
        Social isolation is an absence of social relationships. It is distinct from solitude, which is simply the state
        of being alone. Social isolation can occur in solitude or in the vicinity of others.

        Solitude can be chosen or forced, healthy or unhealthy. Social isolation describes an unwanted and often harmful
        experience. A person may be experiencing social isolation if they:

        Avoid social interaction due to shame or depression.
        Spend extended periods of time alone.
        Experience social anxiety or fears of abandonment at the idea of social interaction.
        Have only limited or superficial social contact.
        Lack important social or professional relationships.
        Develop severe distress and loneliness.
        WHAT IS EMOTIONAL ISOLATION?
        Emotional isolation occurs when someone is unable or unwilling to share their emotions with others. Someone may
        be reluctant to discuss anything but the most superficial matters. Without emotional support, they may feel
        “shut down” or numb.

        Emotional isolation can occur due to social isolation. Yet a person may feel emotionally isolated despite having
        a social network. Even though relationships are necessary for our well-being, they can trigger negative feelings
        and thoughts. Emotional isolation can act as a defense mechanism to protect a person from distress.

        Someone in an intimate relationship can still experience emotional isolation. One or both partners may feel
        alone within the relationship, rather than supported and fulfilled. Infidelity, abuse, and other trust issues
        often cause such feelings. A couples counselor can help partners identify the source of their distress. The
        couple can then work to improve communication and rebuild trust.

      <h5>Struggles I go through in my day to day work life</h5>
      <p id="author">William Cho</p>
      <p class="theStory6">
        <h1>Daily life struggles</h1>
        If you don’t give yourself time to be depressed, you won’t be depressed.
        Now before you get angry about me trivializing depression or saying that I’ll never understand, let me explain
        that this comes from my own personal experience. I am sharing something that has helped me overcome the
        hardest
        moments in my life.
        I am grateful to have lived a life where I did not have parents or loved ones tyrannized, manipulated or
        abused
        me. However, just because you have a normal upbringing and a relatively easy life does not mean you have no
        demons to face.
        My life has been a blur up until college. I lived as a worry-free, happy-go-lucky guy throughout most of my
        life. I did not have a care in the world what the future held for me, and I lived for immediate gratification.
        I loved playing games because I was decent at it. At times it seemed like it was the only thing I could be
        proud
        of. In hindsight, there may be no practical use for being good at a game but at the time it was a great
        confidence booster for me.
        I did not try hard in school to set myself up for a great college or a great career. Life was filled with
        excuses and lies, to manipulate those around me to get what I wanted without remorse. I lied to my friends and
        family for sport. I stole money from my family to fuel my addiction.
        I did not value money because I never worked hard to earn it myself. I always took my position in life for
        granted, babied by my parents and my sister. I did not know the concept of earning your keeps.
        And now, in the present day, the accumulation of my carelessness and reckless abandon has left me lost,
        undisciplined and immature. While everyone grew up and slowly became adults, I stayed in the past as an
        adolescent and refused to look forward. I lived for the moment, and could care less what would happen five,
        ten
        years from now. I wanted to have fun and that was the core of my existence.

            Being bullied can be disheartening and miserable for the one being subjected
            to bullying. Bullying not only happens to children or teenagers but adults can too
            become victims of bullying –
            at the workplace, in families, in relationships, and other social settings.

              Having a strong support system can help you feel not alone. Having people you trust
              around you to back you up can be helpful. Your support system is there to help you,
              encourage you, and help you stay positive. If you’re having trouble dealing with
              bullies, then you can trust your support system for advice. Bullying can be scary
              but it can feel less scary when you have a support system to fall back on.

              If you find yourself being bullied, then you need to speak up and report the incident
              to concerned authorities. Staying silent when you’re being bullied is not healthy or helpful.
              If you speak up and stand up against your bullies today then you are less likely to feel the
              long-term effects of bullying.Remember that by speaking up and standing strong,
              you’re also helping others who can’t stand against their bullies themselves.

              Like mentioned before, dealing with bullies and the effects of bullying can be challenging.
              If you’re facing trouble overcoming the challenges, it is better to seek professional help
              from a mental healthcare provider. A therapist or counselor can help you learn how to block

              The first thing you can do to overcome the effects of bullying is – allowing yourself to just feel
              the emotions flowing through you. Many times, people are told to “get over it” but it is not healthy
              if you don’t allow yourself to process your emotions. Bullying can cause you to feel anger, sadness,
              hurt, frustration, irritation, etc., and experiencing such emotions is okay.

            world that is struggling, which can make you feel very alone. Learning how to deal with depression can be
            the
            difference between you being able to overcome it or simply giving in to the symptoms of it day after day.

              Depression can make everyday life difficult, especially for those with major depressive disorder, which is
              16.1
              million Americans, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. But, treatment,
              including
              internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy, is effective at helping people overcome it.

              Unlike other mental health disorders that can be easier to detect, people with depression may find they
              have
              a
              tendency to "shrug off" their depressive feelings, trying to convince themselves it's just a few off days
              or
              that feeling down or sad is a normal part of life. And it is, but for how long? How do you tell the
              difference
              between sadness and depression?

              If you've wondered if you could have depression or if the feelings you've been experiencing are
              reasonable,
              there are some common signs and symptoms to be aware of that can help you decide if you should seek
              professional
              treatment. These symptoms generally occur for most of your day without letting up and can continue on for
              days
              or even weeks and months at a time. <span class="reply">Reply &downarrow;</span>

              Feeling sad, lost, empty, hopeless, or just generally unhappy
              Losing interest in or enjoyment from activities you previously enjoyed (socializing, sex, hobbies, etc.)
              Changes in sleeping habits ranging from insomnia to spending most of your time sleeping or in bed
              Exhaustion and a lack of energy that makes even simple everyday tasks seem difficult
              Appetite changes (commonly lack of appetite and weight loss but occasionally increased desire to eat and
              weight
              gain)<span class="reply">Reply &downarrow;</span>

              While reading over the symptoms of depression may help you better understand the disorder and give you
              some
              sense of the way you're feeling, a professional diagnosis is typically necessary for successfully
              overcoming
              depression.

              However, if you're still unsure of how severe your symptoms are or want other resources to help you know
              if
              you're depressed, there are online depression assessments available. These assessments will ask questions
              to
              gauge your current emotional state and give you an idea of how it compares to symptoms of depression.
              But a formal diagnosis must come from a professional-typically your doctor or a mental health provider-and
              will
              generally consist of the following diagnostic steps:

              Physical exam: this helps rule out depression-like symptoms as a result of a separate health problem. This
              often
              includes lab tests that can further rule out depression symptoms from issues with hormones, your thyroid,
              etc.
              Psychological evaluation: a discussion of your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns
              (including
              when they started and any notable events that may have happened to you during that time)
              DSM-5: Criteria for depression listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)
